This is a super-simple wiki-like app.

It's almost like del.icio.us crossed with a wiki... when you create an
entry, you assign topics (like tags). Then you can view entries on their own
or grouped with others in the same topic.

The idea is that you have a lot of disjointed thoughts that almost fit
together, or sometimes fit together in different ways.

-----

To run, you'll need to do the following:

1. Install couchdb and make sure it works. Start it.

2. Install enough gems to make these lines work:
require 'sinatra'
require 'haml'
require 'sass'
require 'httparty'
require 'json'

3. rake  (This will load stuff into a 'wiki' database. If you don't want it
          to do that, make the appropriate change to Rakefile and app.rb)

4. ruby app.db
